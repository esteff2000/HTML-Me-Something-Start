      <h2><header>Where It All Began</header></h2>
      <br>
         <main><p>My name is Eleanor Steffenson, welcome to my story of how I've gotten to where I am. I was born and raised (and still currently live) in the suburbs of St. Louis, MO 
         <br>
         When I had first began school, it had become my dream to get into a nursing program so I could become a pediatric nurse. However, life had other plans for me as I fought my way through college
         <br>
         Despite not going into nursing school, I still continued with my passion for healthcare. In 2022, I graduated from the University of Missouri with a Bachelors of Science in Health Sciences - Health and Wellness Services.</p>

         height = "400">
         <br>
         <p>Throughout my time at the University of Missouri, I learned a lot about myself and discovered that I sought to be that person that people could turn to in times of need.<br>
         This dedication to be in a field where I can be the one to help others led me to the current field of work that I have been in since graduating in 2022.</p>
         </p>
      <h2><header>My Journey So Far</header></h2>
         <p>When I graduated in 2022, I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. However, what I did know is I wanted to spread my message that I have been telling myself for as long as I can remember: 
            &quot;Always be kind, sometimes kindness is enough. Sometimes, kindness is all you can give&quot;
         </p>
         <p>Keeping this in mind, I am currently working with children in a preschool setting that uses the &quot;Montessori Method&quot;</p>

         </article>
         <br>
         <p>Although I am very passionate about my job and I love helping my children grow more and more, there is still a part of me that wants to explore the world more. Which has led me to my path of web development.
            Thanks to this desire to keep learning, I began my web development journey with the help of Launch Code.
